  #            k - size of a Bloom filter
  #            h - number of hash functions
  #            m - number of cohorts
  #            p - P(IRR = 1 | PRR = 0)
  #            q - P(IRR = 1 | PRR = 1)
  #            f - Proportion of bits in the Bloom filter that are set randomly
  #                to 0 or 1 regardless of the underlying true bit value
  #    obs_counts: a matrix of size m by (4k^2 + 1). Column one contains sample
  #                sizes for each cohort. Other counts indicated how many times
  #                pairs of bits {11, 10, 01, 00} were set across the two
  #                reports (in a "1st report"-major order)
